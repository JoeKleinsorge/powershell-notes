# ⛔️ DEPRECATED powershell-notes

Reason:
  I have moved my note taking to markdown and Dendron.  

My PowerShell script that helps me keep my notes organized and allows me to use them more effectively. 

I wrote an article on my website if you would like to see the script in action or view some examples.
